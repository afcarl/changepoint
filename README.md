measurechange
=============

I'm trying to figure out whether quantitative methods really allow us to say that literature (or for that matter music) change significantly more rapidly in some periods than in others.

Right now the best notebook to look at is **changepoint.** The **permutation_test** notebook attempts to use a method that was used in Mauch et al. "The Evolution of Popular Music," but I now think that method makes some assumptions (about the independence of observations across time) that are basically not appropriate for historical timelines.
