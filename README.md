measurechange
=============

I'm trying to figure out whether quantitative methods really allow us to say that literature (or for that matter music) change significantly more rapidly in some periods than in others.

The most recent, and most useful, notebook is probably **diagonal_permutation,** which extends methods in Mauch et al. 2015 by  changing the permutation test.

A slightly earlier pass at this problem was **changepoint,** which borrows changepoint analysis from econometrics.

The **permutation_test** notebook iwas my first pass at this problem and is now deprecated.
